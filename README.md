This is a dark and light theme for Obsidian with an overal minimal design and calm but aesthetic colour palette.

I use a Tag-Pill Css Snippet that is not included in the main css file because it is customized to my specific use of tags.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or make some suggestions for improvement. 

(This theme is largely based on the [Dracula for Obsidian](https://github.com/jarodise/Dracula-for-Obsidian.md) theme by jarodise, as well as some snippets from other community themes.)
