# Pine Forest Berry
This is a dark and light theme for Obsidian with an overal minimal design and calm but aesthetic colour palette. 
I use a Tag-Pill Css Snippet that is not included in the main css file because it is customized to my specific use of tags.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or make some suggestions for improvement. 

(This theme is largely based on snippets of other themes and some free-style-css-fiddeling. Mostly the [Dracula for Obsidian](https://github.com/jarodise/Dracula-for-Obsidian.md) theme by jarodise, as well as the [Minimal Theme by Kepano](https://minimal.guide/Home).

## Update Version 1.2:

I cleaned up the CSS and attendet to a few uneven bits. The code block views got an update, the tags should show well in light-mode now and the menues have better contrast and navigation. 

Let me know if there are any issues. 

## Update Version 1.3: 

I fixed the issue with the adjustable font-sizes, added the alternative checkboxes (from the Minimal Theme) and solved some issues that arose from Obsidian Updates.
